# Data-Science-Projects

This repository is a culmination of the work I completed during the summer of 2019 for CS7180: Special Topics in AI. The course consisted of mini-projects to familiarize students with the data science workflow. The final project consisted of an open ended research that I presented at the Seattle Summer Showcase on August 13, 2019.
