# Data-Science-Projects

This repository is a culmination of the work I completed during the summer of 2019 for CS7180: Special Topics in AI. The course consisted of data science projects to familiarize students with the data science workflow, using pandas, sklearn, and numpy. The final project consisted of an open ended research propject that I presented at the Seattle Summer Showcase on August 13, 2019.
